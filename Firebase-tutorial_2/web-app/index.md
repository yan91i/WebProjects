## What You Should Know Before You Begin

- **Basic familiarity with Javascript** will be helpful.
    + If you haven't ever written any JavaScript, that's okay though! You may just have to look up some extra stuff as you proceed through this tutorial.
- **Some familiarity with the command line** is expected.
    + If you've never used the command line before, you may want to try a tutorial for your operating system, or a [general introduction](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) before starting this tutorial.
- **Some familiarity with Git** is helpful. 
    + If you've never used Git or any other version control software before, you may want to glance through [a quick guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) first.
    + If you have used a different version control software before, you may want to check out a comparison between that software and Git to familiarize yourself with the concepts unique to Git.
- Web development experience is **NOT** required.
    + We'll be going over some basics throughout this tutorial!

## Time Commitment
